# ProgrammingIII

Simple repository for the projects made on the university class, programming III.

## First considerations

Please, it would be better if you follow these three like _rules_ that I've thougt for a better work between us:

1. Please try to write all your code in English, also you practice it and it looks better. <3
2. Important, please **always** comment your code. It is easier for us and you to remember what the hell you did.
3. I don't think of more rules. :cry
